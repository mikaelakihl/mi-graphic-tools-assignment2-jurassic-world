# Design Swap
### A fictional premiere page for "Jurassic World Rebirth"

Welcome to "Design-Swap, an assignment we did while studying the Front End Developer Program at Mediainstitutet. In this project we got handed a desing from another group and coded the website acording to their vision. It was also for many of us the first time using Vue and we learned alot about the challenges of creating and handing over a design.  
The website we got handed was for a movie premiere where you can read about film and order tickets. Have a look!
