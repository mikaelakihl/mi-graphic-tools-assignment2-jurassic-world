# About the design
 
We searched for the font used in the movie but couldn't find it for free, so we chose alternative fonts that felt fitting.

After deciding on the movie, colors, and fonts for the project, we experimented with different button designs. We created buttons with various purposes that complemented the overall design.

We designed three versions of the movie premiere page: one for mobile, one for tablet, and one for desktop. For each version, we also created a grid layout.

Our design consists of four pages:

A homepage featuring a hamburger menu for mobile, two buttons, a quote, and a pop-up cookie consent box that can be closed.
An information page about the movie, including an image.
A cast and crew page with a scrollable image gallery and a link for more production details.
A ticket reservation page, also scrollable, including a form for user information.
Each page contains a footer and a navigation bar (for desktop and tablet).

We created an SVG image, which we applied to all pages except the homepage.

For the overall design approach, we started with a mobile-first strategy, as itâ€™s easier to begin with the smallest prototype. Once we were satisfied with the mobile version, we scaled up to tablet. During this process, we discussed design adjustments and how to proceed. For example, we decided to remove the sidebar and hamburger menu for larger screens, opting instead for a top navigation bar, which provided a clean and structured look.

After completing the tablet prototype, we followed a similar process for the desktop version.

To streamline our workflow, we took advantage of Figma's component system. From the start, we created reusable components for all pages. This allowed us to make quick design changes, such as updating a button style, across the entire project efficiently.
